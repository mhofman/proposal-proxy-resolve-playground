Playground for the Proxy `resolve` proposal allowing tunneling of hidden data: WeakMap, internal slots (including private fields), host objects, etc.

The goal of this repository is to figure out if a `resolve` proxy trap allows for tunneling, what signature it should have, and when the language operations should invoke it.
